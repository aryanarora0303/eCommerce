# eCommerce Database Design

## Overview

This document outlines the database design for an eCommerce application with 5 core tables and their relationships. The design supports essential eCommerce functionalities including user management, product catalog, order processing, and customer reviews.

> üê≥ **Docker Support**: This application is fully containerized! See the [Docker Setup Guide](../DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions on running with Docker, or use the Quick Start Docker options below.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development (Node.js)

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Start the Server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

#### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
# Using npm scripts (recommended)
npm run db:seed

# Or run script directly
./scripts/seed-database.sh
```

#### 4. Manage Database (Optional)

```bash
# Clear all data from database
npm run db:truncate

# Seed fresh data after truncation
npm run db:seed
```

### Option 2: Docker Development

#### 1. Build and Start with Docker Compose

```bash
# Start in development mode (with hot reload)
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### 2. Seed the Database (Docker)

```bash
# Using npm scripts (recommended)
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api npm run db:seed

# Or run script directly
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api ./scripts/seed-database.sh
```

#### 3. Manage Database (Docker)

```bash
# Clear all data from database
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api npm run db:truncate

# Seed fresh data
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api npm run db:seed
```

#### 3. View Logs (when running detached)

```bash
docker-compose logs -f ecommerce-api
```

#### 4. Stop the Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The seeding script will generate fresh, random data every time you run it. You can run it multiple times to create more test data.

### Access the API

-   API Base URL: `http://localhost:3151`
-   Swagger Documentation: `http://localhost:3151/api`
-   OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:3151/api-json`

## Database Management

The project includes two scripts for database management:

### Database Seeding

The `scripts/seed-database.sh` script generates realistic test data for the eCommerce API:

#### Features

-   **Unique Data Every Run**: Uses timestamps and random IDs to ensure no duplicates
-   **Dynamic Database Awareness**: Fetches current counts to create realistic relationships
-   **Comprehensive Data**: Creates users, products, orders, and reviews with realistic relationships
-   **Random but Realistic**: Uses arrays of realistic names, addresses, product types, and review content

#### What Gets Created Each Run

-   **5 Random Users**: Unique emails with timestamp, random names, addresses, and phone numbers
-   **10 Random Products**: Varied categories, brands, prices, and stock quantities
-   **6 Random Orders**: Different users, multiple items per order, varied payment methods
-   **Reviews for All Products**: 2-3 reviews per product with varied ratings and realistic comments

### Database Truncation

The `scripts/truncate-database.sh` script completely clears the database:

#### Features

-   **Complete Data Removal**: Deletes all records from all tables
-   **Safe Deletion Order**: Respects foreign key constraints
-   **Confirmation Required**: Asks for explicit confirmation before deletion
-   **Verification**: Shows before/after counts to confirm successful truncation

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Seed database with sample data
npm run db:seed

# Clear entire database (with confirmation)
npm run db:truncate

# Clear and reseed in one workflow
npm run db:truncate && npm run db:seed

# Legacy commands (still work)
./scripts/seed-database.sh
./scripts/truncate-database.sh
```

Each run will show a summary like:

```
üìä Summary of created data this run:
   üë• Users: 5 new random users
   üì¶ Products: 10 new random products
   üõí Orders: 6 new random orders
   ‚≠ê Reviews: 54 new reviews (covering all products)

üìà Current database totals:
   üë• Total Users: 16
   üì¶ Total Products: 41
```

## Docker Setup

This application is fully containerized for easy development and practice:

### Docker Files Overview

-   **`Dockerfile`**: Development-optimized image with hot reload support
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Development environment with volume mounting
-   **`.dockerignore`**: Optimizes build context by excluding unnecessary files

### Development with Docker

The development setup includes:

-   Hot reload support via volume mounting
-   Automatic restart on file changes
-   Database persistence through volume mounting
-   Health checks for container monitoring

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose up --build -d

# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f ecommerce-api

# Execute commands in the running container
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api npm run test
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api ./scripts/seed-database.sh

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Docker Commands Reference

```bash
# Build only
docker build -t ecommerce-api .

# Run standalone container
docker run -p 3151:3151 -v $(pwd)/ecommerce.db:/app/ecommerce.db ecommerce-api

# Interactive shell access
docker-compose exec ecommerce-api /bin/sh

# Remove all containers and images
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

### Database Persistence

The SQLite database is mounted as a volume to ensure data persistence:

-   Development: `./ecommerce.db:/app/ecommerce.db`

### Troubleshooting Docker

```bash
# Check container health
docker-compose ps

# View detailed container information
docker inspect <container-id>

# Clean up unused Docker resources
docker system prune -a

# Rebuild from scratch (no cache)
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

2. **Business Logic**

    - Users can only review products after purchase (optional enforcement)
    - Order total must match sum of order items
    - Products cannot be ordered if stock is insufficient

3. **Security Considerations**
    - Passwords stored as hashes, never plain text
    - User access control for orders and reviews
    - Input validation for all user-submitted data

This database design provides a solid foundation for an eCommerce application with room for future enhancements such as wishlists, shopping carts, promotions, and advanced inventory management.
